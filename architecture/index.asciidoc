GlusterFS Architecture
----------------------

This could be a brief one chapter explanation about how gluster works and
why it makes sense. How much does it scale in practice, what are its
strong points, and why should I use it.

We could list a few success stories / references here and the
reasons why they chose to use glusterfs.

We could then give a few examples of the kind of other uses Gluster makes sense for.
