              <p>This document will get you up to speed with some hands-on experience
              with Gluster by guiding you through the steps of setting it up for the
              first time. If you are looking to get right into things, you are in
              the right place. If you want just the bare minimum steps, see the
              <a id="Getting_started_rrqsg|Really Really Quick Start Guide"></a>.  For a
              little more detail, take a look at the [[QuickStart|Quick Start
              Guide]].  If you want some in-depth information on each of the steps,
              you are in the right place. .  All three will get you to a working
              Gluster cluster, so it depends on you how much time you want to spend.
              The RRQSG should have you up and running in ten minutes or less.  This
              guide can easily be done in a lunch break, and still gives you time to
              have a quick bite to eat.  The Getting Started guide can be done
              easily in a few hours, depending on how much testing you want to do.
              After you deploy Gluster by following these steps, we recommend that
              you read the Gluster Admin Guide to learn how to administer Gluster
              and how to select a volume type that fits your needs.  Also, be sure
              to enlist the help of the Gluster community via the IRC channel or Q&amp;A
              section .  We want you to be successful in as short a time as
              possible.</p>

              <p>Before we begin, let’s talk about what Gluster is, dispel a few myths
              and misconceptions, and define a few terms.  This will help you to
              avoid some of the common issues that others encounter most frequently.</p>

              <div class="paragraph">
              <p>Gluster is a distributed scale out filesystem that allows rapid
              provisioning of additional storage based on your storage consumption
              needs.  It incorporates automatic failover as a primary feature. All
              of this is accomplished without a centralized metadata server.</p>

              <div class="ulist">
              
              <ul>
              <li>
              <p>Gluster is an easy way to provision your own storage backend NAS
              using almost any hardware you choose.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>You can add as much as you want to start with, and if you need more
              later, adding more takes just a few steps.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>You can configure failover automatically, so that if a server goes
              down, you don’t lose access to the data.  No manual steps are
              required for failover. When you fix the server that failed and bring
              it back online, you don’t have to do anything to get the data back
              except wait.  In the mean time, the most current copy of your data
              keeps getting served from the node that was still running.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>You can build a clustered filesystem in a matter of minutes…it is
              trivially easy for basic setups</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>It takes advantage of what we refer to as “commodity hardware”,
              which means, we run on just about any hardware you can think of,
              from that stack of decomm’s and gigabit switches in the corner no
              one can figure out what to do with (how many license servers do you
              really need, after all?), to that dream array you were speccing out
              online.  Don’t worry, I won’t tell your boss.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>It takes advantage of commodity software too.  No need to mess with
              kernels or fine tune the OS to a tee.  We run on top of most unix
              filesystems, with XFS and ext4 being the most popular choices.  We
              do have some recommendations for more heavily utilized arrays, but
              these are simple to implement and you probably have some of these
              configured already anyway.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Gluster data can be accessed from just about anywhere – You can use
              traditional NFS, SMB/CIFS for Windows clients, or our own native
              GlusterFS (a few additional packages are needed on the client
              machines for this, but as you will see, they are quite small).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>There are even more advanced features than this, but for now we will
              focus on the basics.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>It’s not just a toy.  Gluster is enterprise ready, and commercial
              support is available if you need it.  It is used in some of the most
              taxing environments like media serving, natural resource
              exploration, medical imaging, and even as a filesystem for Big Data.</p>

              <div class="paragraph">
              <p>Most likely, yes.  People use Gluster for all sorts of things.  You
              are encouraged to ask around in our IRC channel or Q&amp;A forums to see
              if anyone has tried something similar.  That being said, there are a
              few places where Gluster is going to need more consideration than
              others.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="ulist">
              
              <ul>
              <li>
              <p>Accessing Gluster from SMB/CIFS is often going to be slow by most
              people’s standards.  If you only moderate access by users, then it
              most likely won’t be an issue for you.  On the other hand, adding
              enough Gluster servers into the mix, some people have seen better
              performance with us than other solutions due to the scale out nature
              of the technology</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Gluster does not support so called “structured data”, meaning live,
              SQL databases.  Of course, using Gluster to backup and restore the
              database would be fine</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Gluster is traditionally better when using file sizes at of least
              16KB (with a sweet spot around 128KB or so).</p>

Don’t I need redundant networking, super fast SSD’s, technology from Alpha Centauri delivered by men in black, etc…?</h3>
              <div class="paragraph">
              <p>I have never seen anyone spend even close to a billion, unless they
              got the rust proof coating on the servers.  You don’t seem like the
              type that would get bamboozled like that, so have no fear.  For
              purpose of this tutorial, if your laptop can run two VM’s with 1GB of
              memory each, you can get started testing and the only thing you are
              going to pay for is coffee (assuming the coffee shop doesn’t make you
              pay them back for the electricity to power your laptop).</p>
              </div>
              <div class="paragraph">
              <p>If you want to test on bare metal, since Gluster is built with
              commodity hardware in mind, and because there is no centralized
              meta-data server, a very simple cluster can be deployed with two basic
              servers (2 CPU’s, 4GB of RAM each, 1 Gigabit network).  This is
              sufficient to have a nice file share or a place to put some nightly
              backups.  Gluster is deployed successfully on all kinds of disks, from
              the lowliest 5200 RPM SATA to mightiest 1.21 gigawatt SSD’s.  The more
              performance you need, the more consideration you will want to put into
              how much hardware to buy, but the great thing about Gluster is that
              you can start small, and add on as your needs grow.</p>

              <div class="paragraph">
              <p>In a perfect world, sure.  Having the hardware be the same means less
              troubleshooting when the fires start popping up.  But plenty of people
              deploy Gluster on mix and match hardware, and successfully.</p>
