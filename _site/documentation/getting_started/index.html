        <p>This document will get you up to speed with some hands-on experience
        with Gluster by guiding you through the steps of setting it up for the
        first time. If you are looking to get right into things, you are in
        the right place. If you want just the bare minimum steps, see the
        <a id="Getting_started_rrqsg|Really Really Quick Start Guide"></a>.  For a
        little more detail, take a look at the [[QuickStart|Quick Start
        Guide]].  If you want some in-depth information on each of the steps,
        you are in the right place. .  All three will get you to a working
        Gluster cluster, so it depends on you how much time you want to spend.
        The RRQSG should have you up and running in ten minutes or less.  This
        guide can easily be done in a lunch break, and still gives you time to
        have a quick bite to eat.  The Getting Started guide can be done
        easily in a few hours, depending on how much testing you want to do.
        After you deploy Gluster by following these steps, we recommend that
        you read the Gluster Admin Guide to learn how to administer Gluster
        and how to select a volume type that fits your needs.  Also, be sure
        to enlist the help of the Gluster community via the IRC channel or Q&amp;A
        section .  We want you to be successful in as short a time as
        possible.</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Before we begin, let’s talk about what Gluster is, dispel a few myths
        and misconceptions, and define a few terms.  This will help you to
        avoid some of the common issues that others encounter most frequently.</p>

        <h3 id="_what_is_gluster">What is Gluster?</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Gluster is a distributed scale out filesystem that allows rapid
        provisioning of additional storage based on your storage consumption
        needs.  It incorporates automatic failover as a primary feature. All
        of this is accomplished without a centralized metadata server.</p>
        </div>
        
        </div>
        <div class="sect2">
        <h3 id="_what_is_gluster_without_making_me_learn_an_extra_glossary_of_terminology">What is Gluster without making me learn an extra glossary of terminology?</h3>
        <div class="ulist">
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Gluster is an easy way to provision your own storage backend NAS
        using almost any hardware you choose.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>You can add as much as you want to start with, and if you need more
        later, adding more takes just a few steps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>You can configure failover automatically, so that if a server goes
        down, you don’t lose access to the data.  No manual steps are
        required for failover. When you fix the server that failed and bring
        it back online, you don’t have to do anything to get the data back
        except wait.  In the mean time, the most current copy of your data
        keeps getting served from the node that was still running.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>You can build a clustered filesystem in a matter of minutes…it is
        trivially easy for basic setups</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>It takes advantage of what we refer to as “commodity hardware”,
        which means, we run on just about any hardware you can think of,
        from that stack of decomm’s and gigabit switches in the corner no
        one can figure out what to do with (how many license servers do you
        really need, after all?), to that dream array you were speccing out
        online.  Don’t worry, I won’t tell your boss.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>It takes advantage of commodity software too.  No need to mess with
        kernels or fine tune the OS to a tee.  We run on top of most unix
        filesystems, with XFS and ext4 being the most popular choices.  We
        do have some recommendations for more heavily utilized arrays, but
        these are simple to implement and you probably have some of these
        configured already anyway.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Gluster data can be accessed from just about anywhere – You can use
        traditional NFS, SMB/CIFS for Windows clients, or our own native
        GlusterFS (a few additional packages are needed on the client
        machines for this, but as you will see, they are quite small).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>There are even more advanced features than this, but for now we will
        focus on the basics.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>It’s not just a toy.  Gluster is enterprise ready, and commercial
        support is available if you need it.  It is used in some of the most
        taxing environments like media serving, natural resource
        exploration, medical imaging, and even as a filesystem for Big Data.</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Most likely, yes.  People use Gluster for all sorts of things.  You
        are encouraged to ask around in our IRC channel or Q&amp;A forums to see
        if anyone has tried something similar.  That being said, there are a
        few places where Gluster is going to need more consideration than
        others.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ulist">
        
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Accessing Gluster from SMB/CIFS is often going to be slow by most
        people’s standards.  If you only moderate access by users, then it
        most likely won’t be an issue for you.  On the other hand, adding
        enough Gluster servers into the mix, some people have seen better
        performance with us than other solutions due to the scale out nature
        of the technology</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Gluster does not support so called “structured data”, meaning live,
        SQL databases.  Of course, using Gluster to backup and restore the
        database would be fine</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Gluster is traditionally better when using file sizes at of least
        16KB (with a sweet spot around 128KB or so).</p>

Don’t I need redundant networking, super fast SSD’s, technology from Alpha Centauri delivered by men in black, etc…?</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I have never seen anyone spend even close to a billion, unless they
        got the rust proof coating on the servers.  You don’t seem like the
        type that would get bamboozled like that, so have no fear.  For
        purpose of this tutorial, if your laptop can run two VM’s with 1GB of
        memory each, you can get started testing and the only thing you are
        going to pay for is coffee (assuming the coffee shop doesn’t make you
        pay them back for the electricity to power your laptop).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>If you want to test on bare metal, since Gluster is built with
        commodity hardware in mind, and because there is no centralized
        meta-data server, a very simple cluster can be deployed with two basic
        servers (2 CPU’s, 4GB of RAM each, 1 Gigabit network).  This is
        sufficient to have a nice file share or a place to put some nightly
        backups.  Gluster is deployed successfully on all kinds of disks, from
        the lowliest 5200 RPM SATA to mightiest 1.21 gigawatt SSD’s.  The more
        performance you need, the more consideration you will want to put into
        how much hardware to buy, but the great thing about Gluster is that
        you can start small, and add on as your needs grow.</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In a perfect world, sure.  Having the hardware be the same means less
        troubleshooting when the fires start popping up.  But plenty of people
        deploy Gluster on mix and match hardware, and successfully.</p>
