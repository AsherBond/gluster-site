<p>Ten years ago a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn&#8217;t commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem and no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-team.</p>
