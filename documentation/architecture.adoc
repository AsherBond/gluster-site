== GlusterFS In Brief

GlusterFS is a *distributed file system* capable of scaling to several
petabytes (actually, 72 brontobytes!) and handling thousands of
clients simultaneously. It lets you build a scalable networked storage
using pretty much any common hardware. It is easy to start small and
add more storage later.

GlusterFS combines blocks of storage over the network into a single,
large storage pool that is served to client appliances. Gluster can
deliver *exceptional performance* for diverse workloads.

GlusterFS is *free and open source software* enabling people like you
to build data storage with high performance and great value, for a
variety of demanding applications.

=== Performance Hilights

_Why does Gluster perform so well? We could list a few success stories /
references here and the reasons why they chose to use glusterfs._

_We could then give a few examples of the kind of uses Gluster makes
sense for and what kind of hardware is realistically required to
achieve that._

=== Requirements 

Gluster is compatible with all major operating systems. Windows, Mac,
Unix, Linux and other Unix-like operating systems are all
supported. There are several options and protocols available. For
networking both TCP/IP and Infiniband RDMA are popular choices,
depending on your particular needs.

Native Gluster Protocol :: Native protocol works with Linux hosts that
  support Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) mechanism. Gluster Native
  Client is the recommended method for accessing volumes when high
  concurrency and high write performance is required.

NFS v3 :: Gluster has built-in support for sharing the volume via NFS protcol. This works well for Unix clients as well 

CIFS (Samba / Windows file sharing) :: You can share the Gluster
  volume via Samba, which works well when you want to share with MS
  Windows, or a mix of Windows, Mac and Linux hosts.
