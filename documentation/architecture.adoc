== GlusterFS In Brief

This could be a brief one chapter explanation about how gluster works and
why it makes sense. How much does it scale in practice, what are its
strong points, and why should I use it.

=== Performance Hilights

Why does Gluster kick arse? We could list a few success stories /
references here and the reasons why they chose to use glusterfs.

We could then give a few examples of the kind of uses Gluster makes
sense for and what kind of hardware is realistically required to
achieve that.
