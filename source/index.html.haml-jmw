  %h1 Write once, read anywhere
  %h4 Welcome to the Gluster Community, the home of GlusterFS and related open source data storage and management projects. GlusterFS is a unified, scale-out filesystem that can serve up data simultaneously over many different protocols (SMB, NFS, GlusterFS, Swift, QEMU, Cinder, iSCSI, and more). It takes advantage of commodity, off-the-shelf hardware and was made for open source platforms, making it cost-efficient and flexible.
